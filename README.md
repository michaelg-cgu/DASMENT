# Food For Thought
Food for Thought is a software project team bring clients interactive charts and graphs to better understand their date


## Management Components:
**Management is divided into two websources:**
Milestones can be tracked with [Trello](https://trello.com/b/544N7aI3/dp-project)
Daily Tasks can be viewed with [KanBanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com/board/H8yaMCi)


**Several key components to addres are as follows:**
What foods can affect your appetite, your digestive system  
Interactive binary/boolean model based on what you eat 
Forecast an appropriate (carbs, fat, protein) or overall diet breakdown
Mapping local Yelp restaurants/specific items on Whole Foods app/linking general recipes based on likes + avoid foods that irritate 


# Part A
## Product:
**Health Application Highlights**
This web application leverages Health data to produce various health risks in chart format. Additionally, the tool is an application that can be used to track restaurants and specific foods that did not make me feel well. Eventually, this application produces a list of food and restaurants, derived from my dietary needs (and energy level), providing a list of good foods to eat, restaurants to enjoy, etc.

# Part B
**Decompose your user stories into tasks.**
Team Members: Michael Garcia (MG), Samah Basit (SB), Ali Nusair (AN), Deven Panchal (DP) 
 
* As a user, I want to log in and create an individual profile for myself (priority 10) 
*Frontend Django implementation: 1 week, MG*
* As a user, I want to upload my health data in a particular format and have a section to add/update notes (priority 10) 
*Frontend building questionnaire: 2 days, SB*
*Update sensitivities as they arise*
* As a user, I want to view output of my health statistics compared to general population and other users (priority 20) 
*Visualization component of end result compared to gen pop: 1.5 weeks, MG*
*Visualization component of end result compared to users: 1.5 weeks, MG*
* As a user, I want to receive recommendation and alternative paths based on my health data (priority 20) 
*Recommendations on sensitivity based on upload info: 1 week, AN*
*Alternative suggestions: 1 week, AN*
* As a user, I want a component where I can be directed toward alternatives based on location (priority 30) 
*Frontend locational component: 3 days, DP*
*Backend implementation sourcing GIS data: 1 week, DP*

**Outline what features will be in Milestone 1.0 of your project.** 
1. Designed Database  
2. Login Function
3. Registration Function
5. Upload Feature 
5. Baseline User Graphs derived from Data Research
6. Proposed Mockup  
7. testing  

**Build the iterations (at most 2) that will compose your Milestone 1.0. Record the total days of work and the time it will take for your team to complete that work.**
*Iteration 1 (2 weeks):*
1. Design Database  
2. Login Function with Django Implementation 
3. Upload Feature  
  
*Iteration 2 (2 weeks):*
1. Create Visualizations 
2. Create Recommendations and Alternatives 

**Make sure you have dealt with velocity before breaking into iterations.** 

Milestone 1.0 Timeline: (Oct 5 - Nov 3 - 1Milestone, 2 iterations) Total days of work = 21 days
Starting velocity: 0.35 
Total: 10 hrs/ week 
Velocity calculations? 

4 (persons) X 21(days) X 0.35(V) = 29.4 Amount of work for Milestone 1.0



**Allocate tasks to each team member and record the allocation.** 
As a user, I want to log in and create an individual profile for myself (priority 10) - MG
As a user, I want to upload my health data in a particular format and have a section to add/update notes (priority 10) - SB
As a user, I want to view output of my health statistics compared to general population and other users (priority 20) - All
As a user, I want to receive recommendation and alternative paths based on my health data (priority 20) - AN
As a user, I want a component where I can be directed toward alternatives based on location (priority 30)  - DP

**Create a burn down chart for monitoring your team’s progress.**
* found in projimg folder

**Include evidence that you are meeting for periodic stand up meetings with your teammates, ideally at least twice a week.**
Meeting notes occur at this [link](https://trello.com/b/EF1Bg16A/ist-303-project). View meeting cards

**Ensure that your development and testing environment is set up. Be sure to have some working functional (however rudimentary) and test code in your repository.**
# Testing Environment:
**for Mac:**
Download files from this [location](https://github.com/michaelg-cgu/DASMENT/edit/master/README.md)
Install the following:
* venv
* django
* python3 
* pytest

## install commands:
1. Open the terminal
2. type: python --version
ensure python is installed
if installed, >3.0 continue
3. type: python3 -m pip3 install --user virtualenv
4. in the terminal, navigate to the virtualenv folder using cd commands (change directory)
5. type source venv/bin/activiate
6. verify that (base) has changed to (venv)
7. in venv, type the following:
pip3 install django
pip3 install pillow
pip3 install crispy-forms
8. in venv, change directory again to downloaded github repo. 
9. Navigate to DASEMENT -> FoodforThought
10. in command line, type: ls
11. verify that Manage.py appears
12. type the following: 
python3 manage.py runserver
13. open browser, type the following into the URL: localhost:8000

## Testing
We use pytest-django
* install pytest by pip3 install pytest --user
* in the terminal, navigate to FoodforThought directory, enter the following:
$ python3 -m pytest test/test_urls.py
* test currently fails


## FAQS:
* if runserver error occurs when typing python3 -manageserver, ensure Django is installed in virtual environment
* if no such directory error occurs when running Manage.py or starting up venvironment, ensure you are in the proper place to start the virtual environment or manage.py
